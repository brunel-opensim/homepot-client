# TruffleHog Test File
# This file verifies that TruffleHog secret scanning is properly configured
# and running on the HOMEPOT consortium repository.

# Security best practices:
# - Never commit real API keys, passwords, or secrets
# - Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
# - Use .env files (and add them to .gitignore)
# - Rotate credentials regularly
# - Use service accounts with minimal permissions

# This file confirms that:
# 1. TruffleHog is scanning the repository
# 2. The GitHub Actions workflow is properly configured
# 3. Secret detection is active for consortium compliance

# Last tested: $(date)
# Status: TruffleHog secret scanning operational
