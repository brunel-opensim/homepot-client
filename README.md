> **Private Repository**: This repository is restricted to HOMEPOT consortium members only.

HOMEPOT stands for **Homogenous Cyber Management of End-Points and Operational Technology**.
It is a collaborative, multi-partner project that aims to unify the way organisations manage, secure, and communicate with diverse end-points and operational technology devices across different platforms and environments.

The HOMEPOT Client is one of the building blocks of this vision.
It is designed as a flexible, extensible client system that enables secure, scalable interactions with devices in real-world scenarios such as retail, hospitality, and industrial operations.
