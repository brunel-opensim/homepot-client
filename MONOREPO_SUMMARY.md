# HOMEPOT Monorepo Restructuring - Summary

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Branch**: `refactor/monorepo-structure`  
**Status**: ✅ Ready for Review

## Overview

The HOMEPOT repository has been successfully restructured into a monorepo architecture following full-stack development best practices. This restructuring improves code organization, simplifies deployment, and sets the foundation for future AI/LLM services integration.

## What Changed

### Repository Structure

**Before** (Separate repositories/directories):
```
homepot-client/
├── src/                    # Python backend
├── homepot-frontend/       # React frontend (separate)
└── tests/
```

**After** (Unified monorepo):
```
homepot-client/
├── backend/                # Python FastAPI application
│   ├── homepot_client/    # Application code (formerly src/)
│   ├── tests/             # Backend tests
│   ├── data/              # SQLite database
│   ├── pyproject.toml     # Package configuration
│   └── requirements.txt   # Python dependencies
├── frontend/              # React application (organized)
│   ├── src/               # React components
│   ├── public/            # Static assets
│   └── package.json       # Node dependencies
├── ai/                    # Future AI/LLM services (placeholder)
│   └── README.md
├── docs/                  # Centralized documentation
├── scripts/               # Utility scripts (updated paths)
└── README.md              # Main project README
```

### Key Benefits

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
   - Backend, frontend, and future AI services in separate directories
   - Each component has its own dependencies and configuration
   - Independent development and deployment

2. **Improved Developer Experience**
   - Single repository to clone and manage
   - Clear project structure for new contributors
   - Simplified CI/CD workflows

3. **Future-Ready Architecture**
   - Placeholder for AI/LLM services integration
   - Scalable structure for additional services
   - Modern monorepo best practices

4. **Better Tooling Support**
   - Modern IDE support (VS Code, PyCharm)
   - Consistent code quality across all components
   - Unified documentation and scripts

## Files Modified

### Major Changes (50+ files updated)

- **Backend**: All import paths updated from `src.` to `homepot_client.`
- **Scripts**: All 8 scripts updated with new `backend/` paths
- **CI/CD**: 7 GitHub Actions workflows updated with new directory structure
- **Docker**: Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml updated for monorepo
- **Documentation**: 15+ docs updated with new paths and examples

### New Files Created

- `ai/README.md` - Placeholder for future AI services
- `backend/README.md` - Backend-specific documentation
- `docs/monorepo-migration.md` - Complete migration guide
- `docs/running-locally.md` - Local development guide
- `MONOREPO_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

### Code Quality Improvements

All code quality checks now pass:
- ✅ Black formatting (Python code style)
- ✅ isort (import sorting)
- ✅ flake8 (linting)
- ✅ bandit (security scanning)
- ✅ POSDummy infrastructure gate
- ⚠️ mypy (requires dependencies - passes in CI)

## How to Run Locally

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and switch to the branch
git fetch origin
git checkout refactor/monorepo-structure

# 2. Set up backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .

# 3. Initialize database
python -m homepot_client.database

# 4. Start backend server
python -m uvicorn homepot_client.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# 5. In another terminal, set up frontend (optional)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Verify It Works

- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/health
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173 (if running)

For detailed instructions, see [docs/running-locally.md](docs/running-locally.md)

## Testing

All tests pass with the new structure:

```bash
# Backend tests
cd backend
pytest -v

# Code quality
./scripts/validate-workflows.sh
```

## Migration Path

The migration preserves all functionality while improving structure:

1. ✅ **No Breaking Changes** - All features work identically
2. ✅ **Git History Preserved** - Complete commit history maintained
3. ✅ **Backward Compatible** - Existing configurations still work
4. ✅ **Zero Downtime** - Can be deployed without service interruption

## Documentation Updates

New and updated documentation:

- **[Running Locally Guide](docs/running-locally.md)** - Complete setup instructions
- **[Monorepo Migration Guide](docs/monorepo-migration.md)** - Architecture details
- **[Development Guide](docs/development-guide.md)** - Updated for new structure
- **[Database Guide](docs/database-guide.md)** - Updated paths
- **[Deployment Guide](docs/deployment-guide.md)** - Docker and production setup

- [ ] All API endpoints work (test via /docs)
- [ ] Frontend connects to backend successfully
- [ ] Tests run and pass
- [ ] Code quality tools work in your environment
- [ ] Documentation is clear and complete

## Support

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check [docs/running-locally.md](docs/running-locally.md) for troubleshooting

   - bandit security annotations

## Technical Details

### Package Management

- **Backend**: Uses `pyproject.toml` for modern Python packaging
- **Frontend**: Uses `package.json` for Node.js dependencies
- **Virtual Environment**: Standard `venv` in project root

### Database

- Location: `backend/data/homepot.db`
- Type: SQLite with async support (aiosqlite)
- Migrations: Alembic (configured for backend/)

### CI/CD

All GitHub Actions workflows updated:
- `ci.yml` - Continuous integration
