# AI/LLM Services

This directory is reserved for AI and Machine Learning services for the HOMEPOT Client.

## Planned Structure

```

├── models/          # Trained models and model configurations
├── services/        # AI service layer (LLM integration, inference)
├── training/        # Training scripts and datasets
├── notebooks/       # Jupyter notebooks for experimentation
├── requirements.txt # AI-specific Python dependencies
└── README.md        # This file
```

## Future Features

- **Data Analysis**: LLM-powered analysis of POS device data
- **Anomaly Detection**: ML models for detecting unusual device behavior
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Forecasting device failures
- **Natural Language Queries**: Query device data using natural language
- **Automated Reporting**: AI-generated reports and insights

## Getting Started

*To be implemented*

This directory structure is prepared for future AI/LLM integration while keeping the codebase organized and maintainable.
