- [ ] Supports environment variable configuration
- [ ] Includes example configuration (without real credentials)
- [ ] Documents required permissions/certificates

### Error Handling
- [ ] Handles network errors gracefully
- [ ] Implements proper retry logic
- [ ] Provides meaningful error messages
- [ ] Supports all error scenarios from base class
- [ ] Logs appropriate debug information

### Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for all provider methods
- [ ] Mock tests for external API calls
